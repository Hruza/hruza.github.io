\beginverse
\[D]Here's to us \[G]one more toast and \[A]then we'll pay the \[D]bill\brk
\[D]Deep inside \[G]both of us can \[A]feel the autumn \[D]chill\brk
\[D]Birds of passage, \[G]you and me, we \[A]fly instinctive\[D]ly\brk
\[D]When the summer's \[G]over and the \[A]dark clouds hide the \[D]sun\brk
\[D]Neither you nor \[G]I'm to blame when \[A]all is said and \[D]done\brk
\endverse
\beginverse
\[D]In our lives \[G]we have walked some \[A]strange and lonely \[D]treks\brk
\[D]Slightly worn but \[G]dignified and \[A]not too old for \[D]sex\brk
\[D]We're still striving \[G]for the sky, no \[A]taste for humble \[D]pie\brk
\[D]Thanks for all your \[G]generous love and \[A]thanks for all the \[D]fun\brk
\[D]Neither you nor \[G]I'm to blame when a\[A]ll is said and \[D]done\brk
\endverse
\beginverse
\[D]It's so strange \[G]when you're down and \[A]lying on the \[D]floor\brk
\[D]How you rise, \[G]shake your head, get \[A]up and ask for \[D]more\brk
\[D]Clear-headed and \[G]open-eyed, with \[A]nothing left un\[D]tried\brk
\[D]Standing calmly \[G]at the crossroads, \[A]no desire to \[D]run\brk
\[D]There's no hurry \[G]any more when \[A]all is said and \[D]done\brk
\[D]Standing calmly \[G]at the crossroads, \[A]no desire to \[D]run\brk
\[D]There's no hurry \[G]any more when \[A]all is said and \brk
